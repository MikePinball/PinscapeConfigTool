   Output Port Options
</h1>

<div>

   <h2>Gamma</h2>

   <p>
      If this option is checked, the controller will apply "gamma correction" to the port.
      This adjusts the output's intensity level so that it better matches the way the human
      eye perceives brightness.
   </p>

   <p>
      Gamma correction can be beneficial for ports connected to lighting devices:
      LEDs, incandescent bulbs, light strips, etc.  It isn't usually desirable for other
      device types, such as solenoids or motors.
   </p>

   <p>
      Note that this option is only meaningful with ports that are capable of dimming,
      which means they must support PWM.  Digital ports (Digital GPIO ports,
      74HC595 outputs, and chime board outputs) are limited on/off operation, so they
      can't be gamma-corrected.
   </p>

   <p>
      For simplicity, the controller uses a fixed gamma of 2.8.  Ideally, the exact gamma
      value should be chosen individually for each device, since each device has its own
      unique brightness response curve.  Other factors like ambient lighting also can
      affect the results.  But in practice, the variation due to these factors is usually
      pretty small, so the fixed gamma should be a good approximation in most cases.
   </p>

   <h2>Noisy</h2>

   <p>
      Set this option for ports that control noise-making devices, such as solenoids
      and motors.
   </p>

   <p>
      Each port marked "noisy" is included in the "night mode" cut-off group.  When
      Night Mode is activated, all of these ports will be disabled.  They'll operate
      normally the rest of the time.
   </p>

   <p>
      If you're using the Night mode feature, you should first go through your
      devices and figure out which port you're going to use for which device.  Then
      simply check the "Noisy" box for each noise-making device.  When you turn on
      Night Mode, these devices will be disabled, allowing you to play more quietly.
   </p>

   <p>
      If you're not using the Night Mode feature, you can ignore this option.
   </p>

   <h2>Active Low</h2>

   <p>
      This option reverses the voltage levels for ON and OFF for a GPIO output port.
   </p>

   <p>
      By default, ports are "active high", meaning that the output controller
      sets the port's GPIO pin to "high" (3.3V) when the software port is ON,
      and sets it to "low" (0V) when the software port is OFF.
   </p>

   <p>
      Setting this option reverses those voltages.  An "active low" port's GPIO
      pin is "low" (0V) when the software port is ON, and "high" (3.3V) when
      the software port is OFF.
   </p>

   <p>
      <b>Don't</b> use this option with the MOSFET "booster circuit" described
      in the Build Guide.  That circuit is designed for the default Active High
      triggering.
   </p>

   <p>
      Do use this option if you're using some other type of booster circuit that
      requires active-low triggering.  This is fairly common among third-party
      "relay boards" designed for Arduino projects, for example.  If you have a
      relay board that instructs you to connect the control input to "Ground" or
      "GND" or 0V to trigger it, it's an active-low design and you should select
      this option.
   </p>

   <p>
      Note that this option only works with GPIO ports.  The Expansion Board
      ports and the external output chips (TLC5940 and 74HC595) have different
      designs that can't use this feature.  In the case of the expansion boards,
      it's moot anyway because those boards have their own booster circuits built in.
