   <p>
      This window is designed to help you install and adjust your
      plunger sensor.  It shows the current position reading
      and the calibration data.  If you're using an imaging
      sensor (such as a TSL1410R), it shows a real-time view of
      the captured image.
   </p>

   <h2>Sensor snapshot</h2>

   <p>
      For imaging sensors, the "snapshot" box displays the
      image pixels that your sensor is capturing.  This is updated
      continuously, so that you can immediately see the effects of
      adjusting the sensor position or the light source.
   </p>

   <p>
      The pixels are rendered in shades of gray, since the
      sensors we support are monochromatic.  Black pixels correspond
      to full darkness (or full shadow) on the sensor, and white
      pixels are fully saturated (maximum brightness at the sensor).
      Our sensor types are one-dimensional, meaning that
      the pixel array is one pixel wide.  The display stretches
      out each pixel vertically to make it easier to visualize,
      so the image might look like a bar code or a series of
      vertical stripes.
   </p>

   <p>
      For optimal performance, adjust your sensor and light
      source as follows:
   </p>
   
   <ul>
      
      <li>Position the sensor so that the <b>shadow edge</b>
      is always in view, whether the plunger is pushed all the
      way forward or pulled all the way back.
      
      <li>The shadow edge should be sharp and narrow.
      It's easier to get a sharp edge if you use a "point
      source" - a light source with a small aperture - and
      you position it relatively far away from the plunger
      (on the floor of the cabinet, say).  The light
      source should be roughly centered under the sensor
      and pointing straight at it.
      
      <li>The light source brightness should be set so
      that there's a good degree of contrast between the
      dark and light regions in the image.  If the image
      is all black or dark gray, the light source needs
      to be brighter.  If the image is all white or
      washed out, the light source needs to be dimmer.
      
   </ul>
   
   <p>
      The statistics shown under the image give you some more
      information about the sensor scan.
   </p>

   <p>The Min and Max Brightness levels are on a scale from 0 to
      255.  0 is full darkness, 255 is fully saturated.  If your
      light source is set up properly, the Max value should be
      at least 30 or 40 higher than the Min value.  This indicates
      a good level of contrast between the lit areas and the
      shadows.
   </p>

   <h2>Plunger position</h2>

   <p>If the controller is able to read the plunger position
      from the sensor, the position will be displayed as a
      green bar across the bottom of the snapshot box.
   </p>

   <p>
      If you don't see a green bar, it means that the controller
      can't read the position.  If you're using an imaging
      sensor, this might be because the image is too dark
      or too washed out.
   </p>

   <h2>Current calibration display</h2>

   <p>The snapshot box draws little arrows to show the current
      calibration limits.  The purple arrows show the park position,
      where the plunger sits when at rest. 
      The red arrows show the maximum retraction position.
      If the plunger is calibrated properly, the plunger
      should settle and stay roughly at the park position
      when you're not moving it.
   </p>

   <p>Real plungers always have at least a little mechanical play,
      so your plunger won't come to rest at exactly the same spot
      every time you fire it.  It should be fairly consistent,
      though.  If the park position shown isn't fairly close
      to the actual resting position, re-run the calibration
      procedure.
   </p>
      

   <h2>Calibrating</h2>

   <p>If you just installed the sensor, or you've adjusted
      its position, you should calibrate it.  You can also
      recalibrate any time if the displayed park position
      doesn't look right.
   </p>

   <p>To calibrate, make sure the plunger is at rest at its
      normal park position.  Then click the Calibrate button,
      and follow the on-screen instructions.
   </p>

   <p>Note that the pixel display is disabled during the
      calibration process.  It will resume when the
      calibration finishes.
   </p>
   

   <h2>Timing statistics</h2>

   <p>The scan time shows you how long it takes, on average,
      to take one position reading from the sensor.  For an imaging
      sensor, this is the time it takes for the sensor to snap
      a photo (so to speak) and then transfer the image pixels
      to the microcontroller.  The controller has to read the pixels
      one by one, so the pixel transfer is usually the bulk of the
      scan time for an image sensor.  For an analog sensor (an LVDT
      or potentiometer, for example), the "scan time" is simply the
      time it takes to sample the analog voltage level on the
      sensor output and turn it into a digital reading.
   </p>

   <p>The capture time for images from the TSL141R should be
      about 2.5ms with the current controller software.  That's
      about 400 frames per second, which would be considered
      pretty fast in a regular photography or video context.  A
      high frame rate is good for capturing fast motion, which
      is exactly the situation we have when you pull back and
      release the plunger.
   </p>

   <p>For non-imaging sensors, the "scan time" is usually
      negligible (tens of microseconds), since we only have to
      wait for the analog voltage sampler to take a reading.
   </p>

   <p>The "processing time" shows how long it took for the
      software to analyze the raw data for the current frame to
      determine the current plunger position.  For an imaging
      sensor, this reflects the time it takes for the software
      to analyze the image pixels.  For an analog sensor, this
      is usually zero (or close enough), since we treat the
      plunger position as linearly proportional to the voltage
      level.  In other words, the "processing" is simply a
      multiplication, which takes less than a microsecond on
      the controller's CPU.
   </p>

   <p>The timing statistics are provided mostly as a sanity
      check, to help determine if things are working as expected.
      There isn't anything you can do in the configuration to
      adjust these directly.  If the times displayed aren't in
      the right ballpark, there might be a problem with the
      software or with your setup that bears looking into.
   </p>

   <p>A couple of notes on the timing.  First, the image update
      rate that you see in the setup window will be much slower
      than what you see in the statistics.  The USB transfer to
      send the full image to the PC takes a lot longer than
      reading the image on the microcontroller.  This overhead
      doesn't apply during normal operations - the controller
      normally analyzes the pixels all by itself and never sends
      them to the PC.  So the statistics really do reflect what's
      going on in the controller, even though the viewer window
      can't display updates at the same speed.
      Second, for the TSL1410R sensor, the
      "processing time" and "scan time" happen concurrently,
      because the sensor is already snapping the next photo and
      transferring it to the controller while the controller is
      analyzing the previous one.  This means that the true frame
      rate is basically determined by the longer of the sensor
      scan time and the processing time.
   </p>

   <h2>Full resolution and low res</h2>
   
   <p>If you're using an image sensor, the <b>Full resolution</b> and
      <b>Low resolution</b> buttons let you select how many pixels you
      want to view in the dialog.  This doesn't affect how the controller
      reads the sensor; it only affects the visualization in the dialog.
      The low res mode is offered simply to let you speed up the frame
      rate displayed in the dialog.
   </p>

   <p>The resolution setting doesn't change anything
      outside of the dialog.  It has absolutely no effect on how the
      controller reads the sensor or reports the plunger position in
      normal pinball play.  It also has no effect even within the dialog
      for non-imaging sensors.
   </p>
