	  This window lets you view the joystick input coming from the
	  Pinscape Controller unit.  This shows the processed version
	  of the KL25Z input, in the format seen by Visual Pinball and other
	  software when reading from the joystick.
   </p>

   <p>
	  The accelerometer input should automatically zero itself after
	  about ten seconds if you let the KL25Z sit still.  You never
	  have to calibrate it manually, since it zeroes itself in its
	  current position any time it's stationary for a while.
   </p>

   <p>
	  The plunger readings shown here take into account the
	  calibration.  If the plunger is calibrated properly, the
	  reading should be at the zero point, indicated by the arrow,
	  when the physical plunger is "parked" at its normal resting
	  position.  The bar should move to the right when you pull
	  back the plunger.  If the reading isn't showing zero when
	  the plunger is at its resting position, you should re-run
	  the calibration process from the Plunger Setup window.
   </p>

   <p>
	  The buttons displayed here are the "mapped" joystick buttons.
	  These aren't exactly the same as the physical buttons wired
	  to the controller, because the firmware translates each button
	  press to the mapping you selected for the button, either as a
	  joystick button or a keyboard key.  If you assigned a physical
	  button as a keyboard key, it won't show up here at all when you
	  press it, because the button sends input to Windows as keyboard
	  input instead.  If you mapped a physical button to a joystick
	  button, the assigned button should light up here when you press it.
   </p>

   <p>
	  If you're still setting up your connections, you might find it
	  helpful to look at the Button Tester and Plunger Tester windows.
	  Those will give you a more direct view of what's going on at
	  the hardware level.
   </p>

   <p>
	  The "Capture" option lets you collect readings from the
	  accelerometer and plunger inputs and save the collected data
	  to a file.  This is mostly for debugging purposes.  When the
	  capture section is enabled, hold down the Control key to
	  collect data.  The new readings are added to the text box.
	  (Readings are only collected while you're holding down the
	  Control key to avoid collecting excessive amounts - the
	  readings come in very fast.  When troubleshooting, you usually
	  only want to collect readings related to something specific
	  you're doing, like firing the plunger or nudging the machine.
	  Filtering with the Control key makes it fairly easy to
	  collect a focused set of readings around a particular event.)
	  Once you've collected the readings you're after, you can
	  save them to a file if desired by clicking the disk icon.
	  This can be helpful for sharing the data with someone else
	  who's helping you troubleshoot.
